psutil: This module provides an interface to retrieve system resource utilization details like CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Thresholds: You can define custom threshold values for CPU, memory, and disk space.
Logging: Warnings for threshold breaches are logged to both the console and a log file (system_health.log).
